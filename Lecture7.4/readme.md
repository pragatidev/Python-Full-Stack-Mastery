# Full-Stack Application: A Blogging Platform using Django and Vue.js
In this project, we will be creating a blogging platform where users can create, read, update, and delete posts. We will use Django for the backend, Vue.js for the frontend, and Django REST Framework to handle API requests.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed:

Python
Django
Django REST Framework
Node.js and npm
Vue CLI
Axios
If not installed, you can install these packages using pip for Python/Django related packages and npm for Node.js/Vue.js related packages.

## Step 1: Set up the Django Project and App
Firstly, open your terminal and create a new Django project named blogProject and a Django app within it named blogApp by running the following commands:
````
django-admin startproject blogProject
cd blogProject
python manage.py startapp blogApp
````
## Step 2: Create the Post Model
In your blogApp/models.py, define a Post model with fields for title, content, and author.
````
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField()
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
````

After defining the model, update blogProject/settings.py to include blogApp in the INSTALLED_APPS section.

Then, run the following commands to apply migrations:
````
python manage.py makemigrations blogApp
python manage.py migrate
````

## Step 3: Set up Django REST Framework
Next, we need to set up Django REST Framework (DRF) and create a serializer for our Post model.

In blogApp/serializers.py, create a serializer for the Post model:
````
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Post

class PostSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Post
        fields = ['id', 'title', 'content', 'author']
````
Then, in blogApp/views.py, create an API view for the Post model:
````
from rest_framework import viewsets
from .models import Post
from .serializers import PostSerializer

class PostViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Post.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PostSerializer
````
Lastly, in blogProject/urls.py, we need to include the API URLs:
````
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
from blogApp.views import PostViewSet

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'posts', PostViewSet)

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include(router.urls)),
]
````
## Step 4: Create a Vue.js Application
Having set up our Django API, let's switch gears and create a new Vue.js application for our frontend.

First, install Vue CLI if you haven't done so already:
```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```
Now, create a new Vue project:
````
vue create blogClient
````
Navigate to the new project directory:
````
cd blogClient
````
Then, install Axios:
````
npm install axios
````
## Step 5: Connect Vue.js to Django API
In the src/ directory of our Vue.js application, let's create a new file called api.js:
````javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000';

export function getPosts() {
    return axios.get(`${API_URL}/posts/`);
}

export function createPost(data) {
    return axios.post(`${API_URL}/posts/`, data);
}

// add functions for updating and deleting posts as needed
````
Now, in our Vue.js components, we can import these functions and use them to interact with our Django API.

Step 6: Build and Test Your Full-Stack Application
The final step is to build your Vue.js application:

````
npm run build
````
Now, navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser. You should be able to create, read, update, and delete posts through your Vue.js frontend, with the changes reflected in your Django backend.
